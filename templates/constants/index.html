                <h1>Constants</h1>
                <hr/>

                <p>Constant are really variables that represent quantities that <b>donâ€™t change</b> while the program is running. Variables, on the other hand, often do change. Constants are written in a special way so that programmers know that they will not change. For example, consider this program which can tell you the number of seconds in a given number of minutes:</p>

                <pre class="language-python"><code>"""
File: constants.py
An example program with constants
"""

# an example of defining a constant
SECONDS_PER_MIN = 60

def main():
    mins = float(input("Enter number of minutes: "))
    # an example of using the constant
    seconds = mins * SECONDS_PER_MIN
    print("That is", seconds, "seconds!")</code></pre>

    <p>In this example, the programmer has chosen to define a constant for the number of seconds in a minute. Constants make the program more readable which is important for programming style. </p>

                <p>Constants can be changed between runs (as necessary) and your code should be written with constants in a general way, so that it still works when constants are changed.</p>

                <h2>Definining Constants</h2>

<p>Define constants using an expression with the constant name, followed by the <code>=</code> equals sign, followed by the value. Constants can be any type. By convention constants are written in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE and are defined before the main function. Note that for great style we only define constants before the main functions, not variables! Here are a few examples</p>

<pre class="language-python"><code>"""
These constants don't change while the program is running
