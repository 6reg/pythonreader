                <h1>For-loop</h1>
                <hr/>

                <p>A for-loop repeats code for a specified number of times. For example, here's the code you could write to print "Python rocks socks!" 100 times:  

                <pre class="language-python"><code>for i in range(100): 
   print("Python rocks socks!")
</code></pre>
                
                <p> What does the <code>i</code> in the for-loop mean? </p>

                <p> <code>i</code> is a variable that keeps track of how many times the loop has run. In our loop above, <code>for i in range(100) </code> means that at the start of the loop, <code>i</code> is 0. Each time the for-loop runs, <code>i</code> increases by 1 and keeps going while <code>i</code> is less than 100. Once <code>i</code> reaches 100, the loop stops running.</p>

                <p> Here's the equivalent of the for-loop above, written as a while-loop: </p>
                                <pre class="language-python"><code>i = 0
while i < 100: 
   print("Python rocks socks!")
   i += 1</code></pre>
				<p> Now that we know that <code>i</code> is a variable, we can see how we can use the variable <code>i</code> inside our for-loop. Here is a very simple example that demonstrates that point:
<pre class="language-python"><code>for i in range(5): 
   print(i)</code></pre>

   <p>When this code is run it will procude the following output:
    <pre class="console">0
1
2
3
4</pre>

<p>Notice how i starts at 0 and doesn't every take on the value 5. That is because i keeps track of how many times the loop has <i>completed</i>. Once the loop has completed 5 times, it is finished! The variable <code>i</code> is an integer, and you can use its value in calculations. For example, here's how we can print even numbers: </p>
				

				<pre class="language-python mb-3"><code>for i in range(3): 
   print(i * 2)
</code></pre>

<h2>Understanding Range</h2>

				<p>Range is the function which produces the sequence of values that <code>i</code> takes on. For example when we write <code class="language-python">range(3)</code>, it produces the sequence <code class="language-python">[0, 1, 2]</code>. There are other versions of range if you want to produce other sequences. Range can take in one input, two inputs, or even three:</p>
                <p><pre class="language-python"><code>range(4)        # [0, 1, 2, 3] which is 0 through 4, excluding 4
range(1, 4)     # [1, 2, 3] which is 1 through 4, excluding 4
range(1, 10, 2) # [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] which is 1 through 10, counting by 2s
</code></pre></p>

                <p>If we use the version of range with three inputs, we can specify the start, end and step-size. This program prints even numbers 2 through 10: </p>
				<pre class="language-python"><code>for i in range(2, 12, 2): 
   print(i)
</code></pre>
<pre class="console">0
2
4
6
8
10</pre>
				<p> <code class="language-python">for i in range(0, 12, 2)</code> says: i goes from 0 to 12, exclusive of 12, counting by 2 each time. It doesn't include the final value 12, so the last value i takes on is 10.</p>
