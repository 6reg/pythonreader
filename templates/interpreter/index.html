<p>You write your Python code in a text file with a name like <code>hello.py</code>. How does that code Run? There is program named "python", and its job is looking at and running your Python code. This type of program is called an "interpreter".


<h2> Running code in the Ed Interpreter </h2>

<p>Ed has a python interpreter. This allows it to run and execute your python code.

<p> In Lecture 4, we wrote our first Python program: Hello World! 

To run our code, we need to first open the terminal on Ed. You can find the terminal underneath the code editor. To open the terminal, click the button that says <b> Click here to activate the terminal</b>.

</p>

<img class="mainFigure" src={{pathToRoot}}img/pythonreader/interpreter/terminal.png alt="The terminal is underneath the code editor in Ed. Click on the terminal to open it.">

<p> Now that we've activated our terminal, we are ready to run our program! To run your program, type into the terminal: <code> python filename.py </code>
</p>

<p> So, if we wanted to run our Hello World program, we would type: 
<code> 
    python helloworld.py
</code>

<p> This tells our interpreter: use python to run our file named <code> helloword.py </code> </p>

<img class="mainFigure" src={{pathToRoot}}img/pythonreader/interpreter/terminal2.png alt="The terminal is underneath the code editor in Ed. After typing python helloworld.py and pressing enter, the statement Hello World is now printed out">

<p> Voila! After we type <code> python helloworld.py </code> into our terminal and hit Enter, we see that the interpreter has printed out "Hello World", exactly what we wanted. Great work! </p>







<!-- <p>1. Open a command-line terminal. Mac: run the "Terminal" app in the Utilities folder. Windows: type "powershell" in the lower left, this opens the Windows command line terminal. In the terminal type the command "python3" ("python" on Windows). This runs the interpreter program directly. Type ctrl-d to exit when done (on Windows ctrl-z).

<p>2. If you have PyCharm installed, at the lower-left of any window, click the Python Console tab. Or use the Tools &gt; Python Console menu item.

<h2>Working With The Interpreter</h2>

<p>The interpreter prints a ">>>" prompt and waits for you to type some Python code. It reads what you type, evaluates it, and prints the result - the so called read-eval-print loop (here what the user types is shown in bold)

<pre>
>>> <b>1 + 2 * 3</b>
7
>>> <b>'hello' + 'there'</b>
'hellothere'
>>> <b>max(1, 5, -2)</b>
5
>>> <b>'hello' + 2</b>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
</pre>

<p>This is an excellent way to experiment with Python features to see how they work. If you have some code you are thinking about, it can be quick and informative to fire up the interpreter, and type the code in to see what it does.

<h2>Indent In Interpreter</h2>

<p>It's possible to write multi-line indented code in the interpreter (we will cover those later in this reader). If a line is not finished, such as ending with ":", hitting return does not run the code right away. You can write further indented lines. When you enter a blank line, the interpreter runs the whole thing. (For throw-away code like this, I am willing to indent just 2 spaces).

<pre>
>>> for i in range(10):
...   mult = i * 100
...   print(i, mult)
... 
0 0
1 100
2 200
3 300
4 400
5 500
6 600
7 700
8 800
9 900
</pre>

<h2>Interpreter Hacks: dir help</h2>


<p>With the special <b>help</b> function, you can pull up the PyDoc for each function (the triple-quote comments for a function). To refer to a function within the <code>str</code> type use the form <code>str.find</code>. Note that the function name is <b>not</b> followed by parenthesis - this is the unusual case of referring to a function but not calling it.

<pre>
>>> <b>help(str.find)</b>
find(...)
    S.find(sub[, start[, end]]) -> int
    
    Return the lowest index in S where substring sub is found,
    such that sub is contained within S[start:end].  Optional
    arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.
    
    Return -1 on failure.
